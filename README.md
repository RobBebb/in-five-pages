# in-five-pages

This repository contains short markdown documents of the most common functions and commands that I use.

It is broken down by product/subject depending on how how I felt at the time.

The in-five-pages is meant to keep the documents short and concise without any fluff.

I use Windows 10 and Visual Studio Code to do Flutter development, so all documents relate to this.
